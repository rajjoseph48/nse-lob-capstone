"""
Cost-aware backtest — a SIGNAL-QUALITY assessment, not a tradeable strategy.

Translates a model's class probabilities into long/short/flat signals at a confidence
threshold tau, holds for the label horizon, and reports net PnL / hit-rate / a per-trade
Sharpe-like ratio after transaction costs. Positions overlap (windows are dense), so this
measures whether the directional signal survives costs — it is not a realizable P&L.

Costs are charged round-trip as `cost_bps` of notional (≈ one spread crossing + STT/exchange/
SEBI/GST for NSE index futures; default ~5 bps). Frame results accordingly in the report.

Requires a test dataset produced by nse_dataset.load_nse (it attaches `.mid` raw mid-price and
`.seg` per-day segment ids, aligned to the windows' end indices in `.ends`).
